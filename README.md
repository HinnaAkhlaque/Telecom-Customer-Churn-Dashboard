**1. Project Title / Headline**

**Telecom Customer Churn Dashboard: Demographics & Psychographics Analysis with Power BI**


**2. Short Description / Purpose**

This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom sector using both demographic factors (who is churning) and psychographic factors (why they are churning). The goal is to uncover actionable insights for retention strategies by combining SQL analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**3. Tech Stack**

a)SQL ‚Üí For querying and preprocessing raw churn data

b)Power BI ‚Üí For dashboard design, data visualization, and interactive storytelling

c)DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Üí For churn rate calculations and custom KPIs

d)Power Query (M) ‚Üí For data cleaning & transformation (e.g., unpivoting dissatisfaction factors)


**4. Features / Highlights**

**üìä Demographics Analysis (Who is Churning)**
Churn segmented by gender, relation duration, and service type.

‚Ä¢Males churn almost 3√ó more often (29.9%) compared to females (10.9%).

‚Ä¢	Ufone users are highly dissatisfied (highest % churn).

‚Ä¢	Jazz/Warid loses the most customers in total, hurting the company‚Äôs bottom line.

‚Ä¢	Zong shows strong customer retention (lowest churn at 6.7%).

‚Ä¢  Prepaid churn rate = 19.6%
‚Ä¢  Postpaid churn rate = 17.5%

‚Ä¢  Prepaid customers are slightly more likely to churn compared to postpaid.

**üß† Psychographics Analysis (Why they are Churning)**
Dissatisfaction factors: billing, signal strength, internet quality, etc.

‚Ä¢ Churn is highest in percentage among customers in the 7‚Äì12 month range (26.7%), which suggests they are most vulnerable to leaving once the initial period ends.

‚Ä¢ While long-term customers (>12 months) churn at a lower rate (20.2%), they still contribute the largest churn volume (1640 customers) since they represent the majority of the customer base.

‚Ä¢	The biggest churn triggers are poor voice quality and weak signal strength, both leading to churn rates above 45‚Äì58%.

‚Ä¢	4G availability matters, but it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúcompetitive edge‚Äù than a dealbreaker.

‚Ä¢	Billing dissatisfaction causes churn too, though less severely than network issues.

Customers contacting for complaints have the highest churn rate (35%), showing strong dissatisfaction.

‚Ä¢  Those contacting for information about new schemes did not churn at all (0%), which shows that these interactions are positive and retention-friendly.

‚Ä¢  Customers reaching out for other queries churn moderately (12%), while those interested in value-added services churn at 13%, close to the average.
